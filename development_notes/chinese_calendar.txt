There are simpler and more complex ways to do this.

A more complex way is to use astronomy / astrophysics to calculate the vernal
equinox that lunar calendars are based upon. This is also true for a Nongli
date. Yinli is also a used name?

Agricultural Calendar [
	農曆;
	农历;
	Nónglì;

This package usses another package called "astronomia"

or in Python (This is linked because python is meant to be read and it shows)

Some mathlib functions are leveraged

math.modf(x)
Return the fractional and integer parts of x. Both results carry the sign of x and are floats.

>>> from math import modf
>>> print(modf(5.654654)) 
(0.6546539999999998, 5.0)

Not a tricky function to implement

def modf_b(x):
	a = int(x)
	b = x - a
	return (b, float(a))

print(modf_b(5.654654))
(0.6546539999999998, 5.0)


>>> print(modf(-5.654654))  
(-0.6546539999999998, -5.0)


print(modf_b(-5.654654))
(-0.6546539999999998, -5.0)
